# API Documentation

This SDK implementation the API documentation found at [https://developers.deepgram.com](https://developers.deepgram.com).

# Getting an API Key

üîë To access the Deepgram API you will need a [free Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).

# Installation

To incorporate this SDK into your project's `go.mod` file, run the following command from your repo:

```bash
go get github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk
```

# Requirements

[Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (version ^1.18)

# Quickstarts

This SDK aims to reduce complexity and abtract/hide some internal Deepgram details that clients shouldn't need to know about.  However you can still tweak options and settings if you need.

## PreRecorded Audio Transcription Quickstart

You can find a [walkthrough](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/pre-recorded-audio-transcription) on our documentation site. Transcribing Pre-Recorded Audio can be done using the following sample code:

```go
// context
ctx := context.Background()

//client
c := client.NewWithDefaults()
dg := prerecorded.New(c)

// transcription options
options := PreRecordedTranscriptionOptions{
	Punctuate:  true,
	Diarize:    true,
	Language:   "en-US",
}	

// send URL
URL := "https://my-domain.com/files/my-conversation.mp3"
res, err := dg.FromURL(ctx, URL, options)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("FromURL failed. Err: %v\n", err)
}
```

## Live Audio Transcription Quickstart

You can find a [walkthrough](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/live-streaming-audio-transcription) on our documentation site. Transcribing Live Audio can be done using the following sample code:

```go
// options
transcriptOptions := interfaces.LiveTranscriptionOptions{
	Language:    "en-US",
	Punctuate:   true,
	Encoding:    "linear16",
	Channels:    1,
	Sample_rate: 16000,
}

// create a callback for transcription messages
// for example, you can take a look at this example project:
// https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/streaming/microphone/main.go

// create the client
dgClient, err := client.NewWithDefaults(ctx, transcriptOptions, callback)
if err != nil {
	log.Println("ERROR creating LiveTranscription connection:", err)
	return
}

// call connect!
wsconn := dgClient.Connect()
if wsconn == nil {
	log.Println("Client.Connect failed")
	os.Exit(1)
}
```

# SDK Documentation

We are doing our best to transform the documentation to use native [GoDocs](https://go.dev/blog/godoc) which is done in code. This is ideal because:

- The documentation is extracted directly from the code in this repository
- This encourages the documentation in code to be updated and be correct
- **Most importantly:** This provides a single source of truth. This should be the definative source of documentation for this SDK

We encourage you to view our documentation using [https://go.dev](https://go.dev). The landing page for the SDK documentation can be found here:

# Examples

There are examples for **every** API call in this SDK. You can find all of these examples in the [examples folder](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/tree/main/examples) at the root of this repo.

These examples provide:

- PreRecorded Audio Transcription:

    - From an Audio File - [examples/prerecorded/file](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/prerecorded/file/main.go)
    - From an URL - [examples/prerecorded/url](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/prerecorded/url/main.go)
    - From an Audio Stream - [examples/prerecorded/stream](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/prerecorded/stream/main.go)

- Live Audio Transcription:

    - From a Microphone - [examples/streaming/microphone](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/streaming/microphone/main.go)
    - From an HTTP Endpoint - [examples/streaming/http](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/streaming/http/main.go)

- Management API exercise the full [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations for:

    - Balances - [examples/manage/balances](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/manage/balances/main.go)
    - Invitations - [examples/manage/invitations](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/manage/invitations/main.go)
    - Keys - [examples/manage/keys](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/manage/keys/main.go)
    - Members - [examples/manage/members](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/manage/members/main.go)
    - Projects - [examples/manage/projects](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/manage/projects/main.go)
    - Scopes - [examples/manage/scopes](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/manage/scopes/main.go)
    - Usage - [examples/manage/usage](https://github.com/deepgram/deepgram-go-sdk/blob/main/examples/manage/usage/main.go)

To run each example set the `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` as an environment variable, then `cd` into each example folder and execute the example: `go run main.go`.
